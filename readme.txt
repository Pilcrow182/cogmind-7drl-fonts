Pilcrow's Cogmind-7DRL fonts, release 2017.Aug.01
-------------------------------------------------

These fonts are intended for the 2012 7-Day Roguelike Challenge prototype of
Cogmind, found at http://cogmindrl.blogspot.com/

The game does not scale to specific resolutions and instead renders an 80x60
grid of characters in the given font, so many different sizes needed to be made
for multi-resolution support. Fonts and window sizes are noted below.

The graphical tiles included in this set are partially derived from the ones
included in the prototype, with the rest created by myself (Pilcrow). They are
a 'hybrid' tileset that uses stylized ASCII for enemies while the world around
them is graphical. After copying the desired font size(s) to the game's "fonts"
folder, you may press Ctrl+PageUp or Ctrl+PageDown in-game to switch between
the available fonts, and F3 to enable tiles. You may also switch to fullscreen
mode by pressing Alt+Enter, but note that entering fullscreen with a font too
big for your resolution will crash the game (and erase any current in-game
progress).

Standard (4:3) resolutions:
  The  6x6  font will make a  480x360  window (simple tiles),
  The  7x7  font will make a  560x420  window (simple tiles),
  The  8x8  font will make a  640x480  window (simple tiles),
  The 10x10 font will make a  800x600  window (full tiles),
  The 12x12 font will make a  960x720  window (full tiles),
  The 14x14 font will make a 1120x840  window (full tiles),
  The 16x16 font will make a 1280x960  window (full tiles),
  The 18x18 font will make a 1440x1080 window (full tiles),
  The 20x20 font will make a 1600x1200 window (full tiles),

Widescreen (16:9) resolutions:
  The 16x12 font will make a  1280x720 window (full tiles),
  The 17x12 font will make a  1360x720 window (full tiles),

Detailed Credits:
 * All ASCII symbols/letters and lines made from scratch by Pilcrow.

 * Cogmind, dirt wall, dirt floor, regular floor, stairs, and all equipment
   tiles made from scratch by Pilcrow.

 * Enemies, raw matter, and sensor symbols modified from the prototype's
   cosmic_alien font.

 * Debris, walls (except dirt), and all doors (both open and closed) modified
   from the prototype's original tiles.

The above credits are 100% correct for the 12x12 font. The others sizes are
based on the 12x12, but some tiles (such as walls and doors) have been re-drawn
in other sizes while *mimicking* the 12x12 ones to eliminate any scaling blur.
