The fonts in this folder are the same as the regular ones (thus the same
credits and instructions apply), but these have no gradient shading on the
ASCII symbols/letters. I feel that the shading looks nicer, but I know some
will prefer the brightness offered by these plain white symbols/letters, so
I've included both in this pack.
